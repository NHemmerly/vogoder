# vogoder

A program for converting dialogue text files into unique voices using a soundbank. 

## Overview

This project is inspired by [Animalese](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Animalese), the type of "language" used by characters in Animal Crossing. My goal is to make vogoder as user-friendly as possible, so anybody can record custom sounds and create dialogues using a straight-forward and customizable phonetic typing system. 

## Installation 

Download or clone the repo locally. Sample soundbanks are provided in the `samples/` directory so users can quickly hear some examples of the intended output.
